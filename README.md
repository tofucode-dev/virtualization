# hx Frontend Tech Assessment

This project is intended for use as part of Frontend Tech Assessment at hx. At it's core, this is a basic [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) setup which shows off a Virtualizer component, allowing for live changes to its parameters.

As part of this code submission we expect you to:

1. Review and and understand what the code is intending to do.
2. Identify and fix what is wrong.
3. Ensure the code adheres to best practices in production-level code.

The bare minimum expectation is that the code runs without crashes, and the parameters can be changed without causing any issues, while maintaining the intended functionality.

While not required and not impacting your chances of passing the interview, you may consider aiming for the following stretch goals:

1. Showcasing TypeScript skills by typing some components.
2. Adding unit tests.
3. Styling one or more components.
4. Implementing any other features or improvements you find interesting or important to explain/showcase.

There are no wholly correct solutions we are looking for, rather we are keen to see your thought processes and engineering approach, you may rewrite/comment/critique/take notes in whatever way you find easiest that we can refer to in a group discussion after the fact.

Good luck!
